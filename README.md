The analysis aims at taking an unusal approach to understaning factors which affect an employees decision to quit or to stay, the factors affecting job satisfaction and employee performance.

The aim is to combine management theories with data analysis.

We classify factors based on 'Maslows heirarchy of needs theory' and logistic regression.
As per theory the aim is to study if the heirarchial factors  affecting employees such as 'social needs, self esteem need and safety needs' can be analysed using logistic regression and also to see if there are interdependency among factors.

The insights aim to assist in making better decisions for HR/management when it comes to creating good work culture and employee satisfaction.
